<h2> My School </h2>
<p> I started as a fire science major at UNH and transferred into paramedicine. I am now a paramedic and will soon start full time for a fire department. To become a paramedic I had to take 2 years of paramedic classes and multiple national exams.</p>
<h2> Fun stuff </h2>
<p> On my free time I enjoy being outdoors. Being in the woods, hunting, fishing, shooting etc. I also enjoy riding my motorcycle and taking long drives. </p>
